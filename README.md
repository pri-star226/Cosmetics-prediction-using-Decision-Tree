HITUP: Heart Illness Threat Uncovering Predictor
ü©∫ Overview

HITUP is a predictive model designed to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on patient symptoms, lifestyle choices, medical history, and other risk factors. It utilizes a labeled dataset of 70,000+ records, making it a powerful tool for early detection and awareness.

üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset contains 70,000+ entries with 19 features, including symptoms, medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and the target variable Heart_Risk.

Shortness_of_Breath	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Fatigue	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Palpitations	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Dizziness	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Swelling	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Pain_Arms_Jaw_Back	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Cold_Sweats_Nausea	1 if present, 0 otherwise
High_BP	1 if the patient has high blood pressure

Diabetes	1 if the patient has diabetes
Smoking	1 if the patient is a smoker
Obesity	1 if BMI > standard threshold
Sedentary_Lifestyle	1 if physically inactive
Family_History	1 if family has heart disease history
Chronic_Stress	1 if under chronic stress
Gender	1 = Male, 0 = Female
Age	Patient age in years
Heart_Risk	Target variable: 1 = High risk, 0 = Low risk
